    <h1>About Propertify</h1>

    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      Propertify is a remote-first property management platform designed for owners who need dependable operations without being physically present.
      We combine software workflows with local execution so landlords can manage confidently from anywhere.
    </p>

    <h2>The Problem We Solve</h2>
    <p>
      Remote landlords often face maintenance delays, communication breakdowns, trust issues, and manual processes that consume time and increase risk.
      These gaps create stress for owners and inconsistent service for tenants.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Workflow automation:</strong> structured tickets, status tracking, and reporting.</li>
      <li><strong>Verified local contractors:</strong> trusted execution for repairs and maintenance.</li>
      <li><strong>Human support:</strong> hands-on coordination when automation alone is not enough.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Vision &amp; Mission</h2>
    <p><strong>Vision:</strong> Stress-free property ownership anywhere in the world.</p>
    <p><strong>Mission:</strong> Simplify property management, reduce risk, and improve transparency.</p>
